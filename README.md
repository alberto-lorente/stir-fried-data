## Project Overview

This project focused on analyzing Nobel laureates in Physics and Chemistry through clustering of biographical texts and knowledge graph data, including a comparison of linguistic processing libraries for named entity recognition (NER).

## Two Main Parts

1.**Text and Knowledge Graph Analysis:** We collect and cluster Wikipedia biographies and corresponding knowledge graph data of Nobel laureates in Physics and Chemistry. This involves data collection, statistics, visualization, linguistic processing, and clustering to segment and analyze the collected data.

2.**NER Comparison:** We compare the behaviour of two linguistic processing libraries (e.g., Stanza and Spacy) on NER on the same set of texts and develop methods to compare the Named Entities found in the texts with RDF entities  present in the corresponding graphs.

## Instructions

```shell

```

## Usage
