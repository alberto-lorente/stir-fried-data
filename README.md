## This project falls into two main parts

1. Carries out clustering using two different types of input formats. The emphasis in that part is on data collection, statistics, visualisation, linguistic processing and clustering. You will collect wikipedia biographies as well as knowledge graph facts for two categories of people, compute statistics about the two sets
of persons. You will then produce visualisation of their content and train/test a clustering model which should automatically segment the data you collected.
2. Compares the behaviour of two linguistic processing libraries (e.g., Stanza and Spacy) on the task of named entity recognition (NER) on the same set of texts. Different libraries will yield different results and the goal of this part of the project is to analyse these differences. You will also develop methods for comparing the Named Entities found in a text with the RDF entities present in the corresponding graph.
