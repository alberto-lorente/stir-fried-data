The Nobel Committee recognized his \"excellent work on organometallic compounds [which]...led to new polymerization reactions and ... paved the way for new and highly useful industrial processes\". He is also known for his work involving free-radicals, many-membered rings, and organometallic compounds, as well as the development of Ziegler\u2013Natta catalyst. One of many awards Ziegler received was the Werner von Siemens Ring in 1960 jointly with Otto Bayer and Walter Reppe, for expanding the scientific knowledge of and the technical development of new synthetic materials."
