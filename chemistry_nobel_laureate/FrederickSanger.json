He is one of only three people to have done so in the same category (the others being John Bardeen in physics and Karl Barry Sharpless in chemistry), and one of five persons with two Nobel Prizes. He won the 1958 Prize for his research in determining the structure of numerous proteins, most importantly insulin, and shared half the 1980 Prize with Walter Gilbert for the invention of the first-ever DNA sequencing technique, still in broad use today."
