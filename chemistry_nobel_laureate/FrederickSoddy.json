He also proved the existence of isotopes of certain radioactive elements. In 1921 he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"for his contributions to our knowledge of the chemistry of radioactive substances, and his investigations into the origin and nature of isotopes\". Soddy was a polymath who mastered chemistry, nuclear physics, statistical mechanics, finance and economics."
